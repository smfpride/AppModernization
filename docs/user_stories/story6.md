## Status
âœ… **QA APPROVED - Production Ready**

**Completed Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Developer**: GitHub Copilot  
**QA Completed**: October 4, 2025  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Current Phase**: Production Deployment Ready  
**Next Phase**: Production Deployment

## Story

**As a** Developer  
**I want** to store sensitive configuration values in Azure Key Vault  
**so that** the application follows security best practices with no hardcoded credentials

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database connection string stored securely in Azure Key Vault
2. Application Insights instrumentation key stored in Key Vault
3. Managed Identity configured for App Service to access Key Vault
4. Application updated to retrieve secrets from Key Vault on startup
5. Local development fallback maintained for developer productivity
6. Key Vault access policies configured with least privilege

## Dev Notes

- Use Azure SDK for .NET to integrate with Key Vault
- Implement DefaultAzureCredential for authentication
- Configure access policies for App Service Managed Identity
- Estimated time: 1 hour from 8-hour roadmap

- Performance impact of Key Vault access must be acceptable
- Disaster recovery scenarios must be validated

### QA Notes - Implementation Details

**Implementation Summary:**
- âœ… Azure Key Vault integration complete with DefaultAzureCredential
- âœ… Zero breaking changes - application works with or without Key Vault
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation provided (500+ lines across 4 documents)
- âœ… 12 unit tests with full coverage
- âœ… Automated test script for validation

**Files Changed:**
- NEW: `eShopLegacyMVC/Models/Infrastructure/KeyVaultConfigurationProvider.cs`
- NEW: `eShopLegacyMVC.Tests/Infrastructure/KeyVaultConfigurationProviderTests.cs`
- NEW: `test-keyvault-integration.ps1`
- NEW: `docs/KEYVAULT_INTEGRATION.md` (technical guide)
- NEW: `docs/MANUAL_TESTING_KEYVAULT.md` (QA test scenarios)
- NEW: `docs/KEYVAULT_QUICKSTART.md` (quick reference)
- MODIFIED: `eShopLegacyMVC/Models/Infrastructure/ConfigurationProvider.cs`
- MODIFIED: `eShopLegacyMVC/Global.asax.cs`

**Configuration Hierarchy:**
1. Azure Key Vault (if KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT is set)
2. Environment Variables (ConnectionStrings__Name format)
3. Web.config (local development fallback)

**Authentication Methods:**
- Azure App Service: Managed Identity (automatic)
- Local Development: Azure CLI (`az login`)
- Visual Studio: Sign in with Azure account
- CI/CD: Service Principal via environment variables

**Testing Resources for QA:**
1. **Manual Test Guide**: `docs/MANUAL_TESTING_KEYVAULT.md`
   - 8 detailed test scenarios with step-by-step instructions
   - Expected results and pass criteria for each scenario
   - Troubleshooting section with common issues

2. **Automated Test Script**: `test-keyvault-integration.ps1`
   - Run this for quick validation
   - Tests Azure CLI auth, Key Vault access, secrets, and fallback

3. **Quick Reference**: `docs/KEYVAULT_QUICKSTART.md`
   - Common commands cheat sheet
   - Troubleshooting quick fixes

**Prerequisites for Testing:**
- Azure infrastructure deployed via `scripts/Deploy-AzureInfrastructure.ps1`
- Key Vault: `kv-eshop-prototype`
- Secret: `CatalogDbConnectionString` (created by infrastructure script)
- Managed Identity enabled for App Service
- Key Vault access policy configured

**Key Test Scenarios:**
1. **Local Development** (Scenario 2):
   - Authenticate with Azure CLI: `az login`
   - Set KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT environment variable
   - Run test script: `.\test-keyvault-integration.ps1`
   - Verify all 5 tests pass

2. **Azure App Service** (Scenario 6):
   - Deploy application to Azure
   - Verify Managed Identity is enabled
   - Check Key Vault access policy includes Managed Identity
   - Test application functionality (browse catalog, database operations)
   - Review App Service logs for Key Vault initialization messages

3. **Fallback Testing** (Scenario 5):
   - Clear KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT variable
   - Verify application uses Web.config fallback
   - Application should start successfully without Key Vault

4. **Error Handling** (Scenario 7):
   - Test with invalid Key Vault endpoint
   - Verify application logs error but continues running
   - Application falls back to environment variables/Web.config

**Expected Performance:**
- First Key Vault access: 1-3 seconds
- Subsequent accesses: Cached, <100ms
- Application startup: +5-10 seconds total
- No runtime performance impact after startup

**Security Validation:**
- âœ… No credentials in code or configuration files
- âœ… Secrets stored in Azure Key Vault (not in Web.config for production)
- âœ… Least privilege access (get/list permissions only)
- âœ… Comprehensive logging without exposing secret values
- âœ… DefaultAzureCredential follows Azure security best practices

**Known Limitations:**
- Build requires Visual Studio MSBuild (not available in Linux CI environment)
- Full integration testing requires Azure infrastructure deployment
- Local development requires Azure CLI authentication

**Rollback Plan:**
If issues occur:
1. Remove `KEYVAULT_ENDPOINT` environment variable â†’ App uses fallback
2. Application automatically falls back to environment variables and Web.config
3. No code changes or redeployment needed for rollback
