# Test Case 8: Story 8 Critical Deployment Issue Investigation

## Overview
Detailed test case documenting the critical deployment failure discovered during Story 8 end-to-end integration testing.

## Test Environment
- **Target URL**: https://app-eshop-prototype-eastus2.azurewebsites.net
- **Expected**: eShopLegacyMVC application
- **Actual**: Default Azure App Service welcome page
- **Test Date**: October 5, 2025
- **QA Engineer**: Taylor

---

## TC055: Application Deployment Verification
**Objective**: Verify that the eShopLegacyMVC application is properly deployed and accessible

**Prerequisites**: 
- Story 7 marked as "DevOps Complete"
- App Service should be configured for container deployment
- Container image available in ACR

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to https://app-eshop-prototype-eastus2.azurewebsites.net
2. Verify HTTP response status
3. Check page title and content
4. Validate SSL certificate
5. Inspect response headers

**Expected Results**:
- HTTP 200 OK response
- eShopLegacyMVC application home page
- Page title containing "eShop" or application name
- Proper SSL certificate for azurewebsites.net domain

**Actual Results**:
- ❌ HTTP 200 OK (correct status)
- ❌ Default Azure App Service welcome page (wrong content)
- ❌ Page title: "Microsoft Azure App Service - Welcome" (should be eShop)
- ✅ SSL certificate valid for *.azurewebsites.net

**Status**: CRITICAL FAILURE
**Root Cause**: App Service not configured for container deployment

---

## TC056: Container Registry Verification
**Objective**: Verify container image exists and is accessible in Azure Container Registry

**Test Steps**:
1. Query ACR for available repositories: `az acr repository list --name "acreshopprototype"`
2. Check available tags: `az acr repository show-tags --name "acreshopprototype" --repository "eshoplegacymvc"`
3. Verify image accessibility

**Expected Results**:
- Repository "eshoplegacymvc" exists
- Tag "v1.0" available
- Image accessible for deployment

**Actual Results**:
- ✅ Repository "eshoplegacymvc" exists
- ✅ Tag "v1.0" available  
- ✅ Full image path: acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0

**Status**: PASS
**Finding**: Container image is properly built and stored in ACR

---

## TC057: App Service Container Configuration Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze App Service configuration to identify deployment configuration issues

**Test Steps**:
1. Get App Service configuration: `az webapp config show`
2. Check container settings: `az webapp config container show`
3. Verify deployment source: `az webapp deployment source show`
4. Analyze configuration for container deployment indicators

**Expected Results**:
- Container configuration present (windowsFxVersion or linuxFxVersion)
- Container registry settings configured
- Deployment source configured for container

**Actual Results**:
- ❌ `linuxFxVersion`: "" (empty)
- ❌ `windowsFxVersion`: null
- ❌ `scmType`: "None" (no deployment source)
- ❌ `netFrameworkVersion`: "v4.0" (regular .NET app configuration)
- ⚠️ ACR settings present but not used

**Status**: CRITICAL FAILURE  
**Finding**: App Service configured as regular Windows app, not container app

---

## TC058: Infrastructure Resource Validation
**Objective**: Verify all required Azure resources are properly created and configured

**Test Steps**:
1. Check App Service status: `az webapp show`
2. Verify resource group contains all required resources
3. Validate App Service Plan configuration
4. Check managed identity and ACR access

**Expected Results**:
- App Service running and accessible
- All infrastructure resources operational
- Proper security configuration

**Actual Results**:
- ✅ App Service state: "Running"
- ✅ Resource group: rg-eshop-prototype-eastus2 exists
- ✅ App Service Plan: asp-eshop-prototype-eastus2 (S1 Standard)
- ✅ Managed Identity enabled
- ✅ ACR access configured

**Status**: PASS
**Finding**: Infrastructure is properly provisioned but misconfigured for deployment

## Summary of Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Container Deployment Configuration Missing
**Description**: App Service configured as regular Windows app instead of Windows container app
**Impact**: Complete deployment failure - application not accessible
**Responsibility**: DevOps
**Severity**: Critical

### Issue #2: Deployment Process Incomplete  
**Description**: Container built and pushed to ACR but never deployed to App Service
**Impact**: Story 7 marked complete but deployment actually failed
**Responsibility**: DevOps
**Severity**: Critical

### Issue #3: Story Status Inconsistency
**Description**: Story 7 marked as "DevOps Complete" but deployment verification never performed
**Impact**: Downstream testing blocked, project timeline at risk
**Responsibility**: DevOps + QA Process
**Severity**: High

## Required Fixes

### DevOps Team Tasks
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Configure App Service for Windows container deployment
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Deploy container image from ACR to App Service  
3. **HIGH**: Implement deployment verification process
4. **HIGH**: Update deployment scripts to include container configuration
5. **MEDIUM**: Add health checks and monitoring

### Development Team Tasks
1. **HIGH**: Verify container image functionality in local environment
2. **MEDIUM**: Review and test container startup process
3. **LOW**: Add additional logging for deployment troubleshooting

### QA Process Improvements
1. **HIGH**: Add deployment verification step before marking stories complete
2. **MEDIUM**: Create automated smoke tests for deployment validation
3. **MEDIUM**: Implement end-to-end testing pipeline

**Test Case Result**: CRITICAL FAILURE - Complete deployment verification failure
**Next Actions**: Block Story 8 until deployment issues resolved, escalate to DevOps team
