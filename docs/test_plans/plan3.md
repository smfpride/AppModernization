# Test Plan 3: .NET 8 Migration Validation for Story 9

## Test Plan Overview

**Story**: Story 9 - Modernize eShopLegacyMVC Application Code to .NET 8  
**Date Created**: October 5, 2025  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Version**: 1.0

## Objective

Validate the successful migration of the eShopLegacyMVC application from .NET Framework 4.7.2 to .NET 8, ensuring all functionality is preserved and the application meets modern .NET standards.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Build verification for both main and test projects
- Framework migration validation (ASP.NET Core MVC, EF Core 8)
- Package compatibility and dependency resolution
- Unit test execution and validation
- Configuration system migration verification
- Performance and compatibility validation

### Out of Scope
- Database migration execution (covered in deployment testing)
- Live Azure Key Vault integration testing (requires live endpoints)
- End-to-end functional testing (covered in integration testing)
- Production deployment validation

## Test Environment

- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code
- **Build System**: .NET CLI (dotnet command)
- **Test Framework**: MSTest
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **SDK Version**: .NET 9.0.305 (supports .NET 8)

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Build Verification Tests
**Objective**: Ensure both projects build successfully with .NET 8

#### Test Cases:
- TC8.1: Solution-level build verification
- TC8.2: Main project build verification
- TC8.3: Test project build verification
- TC8.4: Package restoration verification
- TC8.5: Cross-configuration build testing

### Phase 2: Framework Migration Tests
**Objective**: Validate successful framework component migrations

#### Test Cases:
- TC9.1: ASP.NET Core MVC controller validation
- TC9.2: Entity Framework Core 8 integration
- TC9.3: Dependency injection container verification
- TC9.4: Configuration system migration validation
- TC9.5: Static files and wwwroot validation

### Phase 3: Unit Test Validation
**Objective**: Ensure all unit tests execute and functionality is preserved

#### Test Cases:
- TC10.1: Unit test execution verification
- TC10.2: Test result analysis and validation
- TC10.3: Skipped test investigation
- TC10.4: Legacy test compatibility verification

### Phase 4: Package and Dependency Tests
**Objective**: Validate NuGet package compatibility and dependency resolution

#### Test Cases:
- TC11.1: NuGet package compatibility verification
- TC11.2: Azure SDK integration validation
- TC11.3: Entity Framework Core package validation
- TC11.4: Application Insights package validation

## Success Criteria

### Build Success Criteria
- ✅ Solution builds without errors
- ✅ Both projects target .NET 8.0
- ✅ All NuGet packages restore successfully
- ⚠️ Build warnings are acceptable if related to nullable reference types

### Functionality Success Criteria
- ✅ Unit test pass rate ≥ 85%
- ✅ No critical functionality regression
- ✅ Framework components successfully migrated
- ✅ Configuration system working

### Performance Success Criteria
- Build time remains reasonable (< 1 minute for clean build)
- Test execution time remains acceptable (< 30 seconds)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- Entity Framework 6 to EF Core 8 migration
- Configuration system changes (Web.config to appsettings.json)
- Dependency injection container changes

### Medium Risk Areas
- NuGet package compatibility
- Static file serving changes
- Authentication/authorization changes

### Low Risk Areas
- Basic controller functionality
- Model definitions
- Unit test framework compatibility

## Test Data Requirements

- Sample configuration files for testing
- Mock data for unit tests
- Test database connections (if applicable)

## Entry Criteria

- ✅ Code migration completed
- ✅ Projects compile successfully
- ✅ Solution file updated
- ✅ Build environment configured

## Exit Criteria

- All test cases executed
- Test results documented
- Pass rate meets success criteria
- Critical issues resolved or documented

## Deliverables

1. Test execution results
2. Defect reports (if any)
3. Updated QA section in Story 9
4. Recommendations for deployment

## Test Schedule

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

- Phase 1: 30 minutes
- Phase 2: 60 minutes  
- Phase 3: 30 minutes
- Phase 4: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes

## Notes

- Focus on automated testing where possible
- Document any breaking changes identified
- Validate nullable reference type warnings are acceptable
- Ensure backward compatibility considerations are noted
