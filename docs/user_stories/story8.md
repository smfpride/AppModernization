# Story 8: End-to-End Integration Testing and Validation

## Status
üö® QA FAILED - Critical Deployment Issue

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer  
**I want** to validate that all eShopLegacyMVC functionality works correctly in Azure  
**so that** we can confirm the prototype meets acceptance criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Catalog page displays all products correctly from Azure SQL Database
2. Product images load successfully from the deployed application
3. Brand and type filtering functionality works as expected
4. Web API endpoints return correct JSON responses
5. Application Insights logs basic request/response data
6. No error messages or broken functionality observed during testing

## Dev Notes

- Test complete user journey through catalog functionality
- Validate API endpoints using browser dev tools or Postman
- Check Application Insights for basic telemetry
- Estimated time: 1 hour from 8-hour roadmap

## QA Results

**Status**: üö® **QA FAILED - CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE**  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Test Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Test Plan**: [Story 8 Critical Issue Analysis](../test_plans/plan3.md)  
**Test Cases**: [Critical Deployment Investigation](../test_cases/case8.md) - TC055 through TC058  
**Priority**: Critical - Complete deployment failure blocking all testing  

### üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

**PRIMARY ISSUE**: App Service serving default Azure welcome page instead of eShopLegacyMVC application

**ROOT CAUSE**: App Service configured as regular Windows app, not Windows container app
- Container image exists in ACR: `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0` ‚úÖ
- App Service not configured for container deployment ‚ùå
- Story 7 marked "Complete" but deployment actually failed ‚ùå

### Test Results Summary
| Test Category | Status | Result |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| Application Accessibility | ‚ùå CRITICAL FAIL | Default Azure page instead of app |
| Catalog Functionality | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| Filtering & Search | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| Web API Endpoints | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| Application Insights | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| Performance & Security | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | HTTPS works, wrong content served |

### Acceptance Criteria Status
‚ùå **ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FAILED** - Application not accessible

### Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete system failure
- **User Impact**: 100% - No functionality available  
- **Project Impact**: Story 7 and 8 both failed, timeline at risk

### Notes
- Infrastructure properly provisioned but misconfigured
- Container build and ACR push successful
- Gap in deployment process between ACR and App Service
- Requires immediate DevOps intervention


## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### DevOps Team Tasks (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Configure App Service for Windows container deployment
  - Set `windowsFxVersion` to container image URI
  - Configure container registry authentication
  - Update deployment configuration from "code" to "container"
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Deploy container image `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0` to App Service
  - Verify container pull from ACR successful
  - Validate container startup logs
  - Confirm application responds correctly
- [ ] **HIGH**: Implement deployment verification process
  - Add smoke test to validate actual application deployment
  - Create health check endpoint verification  
  - Update deployment scripts to validate success
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix Story 7 status - mark as "FAILED" until container deployment complete
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add container monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Document container deployment process and troubleshooting steps

### Development Team Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)  
- [ ] **HIGH**: Verify container image functionality in local Windows container environment
  - Test `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0` locally
  - Validate application startup and basic functionality
  - Confirm database connection strings work in container
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Review container configuration and environment variables
  - Validate Dockerfile configuration for Azure App Service
  - Check required environment variables are properly set
  - Test container health check endpoint
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add additional application logging for deployment troubleshooting
- [ ] **LOW**: Create container troubleshooting documentation

### QA Process Improvement Tasks
- [ ] **HIGH**: Create deployment verification checklist for future stories
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Develop automated smoke tests for post-deployment validation
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Update story completion criteria to include deployment verification
- [ ] **LOW**: Document lessons learned from this deployment failure

## Original Tasks / Subtasks (BLOCKED until deployment fixed)
- [ ] Test catalog page load and display
- [ ] Verify product images display correctly  
- [ ] Test filtering by brand and type
- [ ] Validate Web API endpoints functionality
- [ ] Check Application Insights for request logging
- [ ] Document any issues or performance observations

## Definition of Done (UPDATED)
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE**: Container successfully deployed and application accessible at public URL
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE**: All DevOps critical tasks completed and verified
- [ ] All core catalog functionality validated
- [ ] No critical errors or broken features found
- [ ] Application Insights showing basic telemetry data
- [ ] Prototype meets all defined acceptance criteria
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed and documented

## Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: DevOps team resolves container deployment issues
2. **AFTER DEPLOYMENT**: QA re-executes full Story 8 test suite
3. **FINAL**: Update story status based on complete test results
