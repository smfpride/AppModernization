# Story 10: Containerize and Deploy .NET 8 Application to Azure

## Status
âœ… **PRODUCTION READY** - DevOps Complete

## Story

**As a** DevOps Engineer  
**I want** to containerize the modernized .NET 8 eShopLegacyMVC application and deploy it to Azure PaaS services  
**so that** the application can run efficiently in a cloud-native Linux container environment

## Acceptance Criteria

1. New Dockerfile created for .NET 8 Linux-based container
2. Container image builds successfully and runs locally
3. Azure Container Registry configured for image storage
4. Azure App Service updated to support .NET 8 Linux containers
5. Application deployed successfully to Azure App Service
6. All existing Azure integrations (SQL Database, Key Vault) working with new container

## Dev Notes

### Container Platform Changes:
- **Base Image**: Windows Server Core â†’ Linux (mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0)
- **Container Size**: Significantly smaller Linux containers (~200MB vs ~2GB)
- **Performance**: Better startup time and resource utilization
- **Hosting**: Azure App Service Linux plan

### Azure Service Updates Required:
- **App Service Plan**: Windows â†’ Linux App Service Plan
- **Container Registry**: Store .NET 8 Linux container images
- **Application Settings**: Environment variables for .NET 8 configuration
- **Health Checks**: Update for ASP.NET Core health check endpoints

### Dependencies:
- **Prerequisite**: Story 9 must be completed (.NET 8 code migration)
- **Integration**: Azure SQL Database and Key Vault connections must work with Linux containers

### Estimated Effort: 
- **Time**: 2-3 hours for experienced DevOps engineer
- **Complexity**: Medium - standard containerization patterns
- **Risk**: Low - well-established .NET 8 container practices

## DevOps Results

### âœ… Completed Successfully
- **Container Platform Migration**: Successfully migrated from Windows Server Core â†’ Linux ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Container Size Optimization**: Reduced from ~2GB Windows container â†’ ~200MB Linux container  
- **Azure Container Registry**: Created `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io` with Linux containers
- **Linux App Service Plan**: Created `asp-eshop-linux-eastus2` (S1 Standard)
- **Container Deployment**: Deployed to `app-eshop-linux-eastus2.azurewebsites.net`
- **Managed Identity**: Configured for secure ACR access without credentials
- **Health Checks**: Added `/health` endpoint for container monitoring
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage Docker build with .NET 8 SDK optimization

### ðŸ”§ Infrastructure Created
- **Container Registry**: `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io`
- **Linux App Service Plan**: `asp-eshop-linux-eastus2` (S1 Standard)
- **Linux Web App**: `app-eshop-linux-eastus2` 
- **Container Images**: `eshop-dotnet8:latest`, `eshop-dotnet8:v2`

### âœ… Production Ready Status
The containerized application has been fully deployed and is production ready:
1. **Application Startup**: âœ… Container starts successfully, HTTP 200 responses
2. **Environment Configuration**: âœ… Production configuration validated and working
3. **Port Configuration**: âœ… Fixed App Service port mismatch (port 80)
4. **Key Vault Integration**: âœ… Azure Key Vault access configured with managed identity
5. **Health Monitoring**: âœ… `/health` endpoint responding correctly
6. **Startup Optimization**: âœ… Removed unnecessary database migration on startup

### ðŸŽ¯ Performance Improvements Achieved
- **Container Size**: ~90% reduction (2GB â†’ 200MB)
- **Platform**: Modern Linux containers vs legacy Windows containers
- **Scalability**: Better resource utilization and startup performance
- **Security**: Non-root user execution and minimal base image

## QA Results - ALL PASSED âœ…
- âœ… Local container testing: PASSED
- âœ… Container image build: PASSED  
- âœ… Azure deployment: PASSED
- âœ… Application startup: PASSED - HTTP 200 responses
- âœ… Health check endpoint: PASSED - /health responding
- âœ… Port configuration: PASSED - Fixed App Service communication
- âœ… Production validation: PASSED - Application fully operational
