# Story 5: Migrate Database Data to Azure SQL Database

## Status
Ready for QA

## Story

**As a** Database Developer  
**I want** to migrate the catalog data from LocalDB to Azure SQL Database  
**so that** the application has access to the complete product catalog in the cloud

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All catalog data exported from LocalDB (CatalogItems, CatalogBrands, CatalogTypes)
2. Data imported successfully into Azure SQL Database
3. Data integrity validation shows 100% record count match
4. Foreign key relationships and constraints validated
5. Sample queries return expected results
6. Application can successfully retrieve and display catalog data

## Dev Notes

- Use SSMS Export/Import wizard or BCP utility
- Validate data integrity after migration
- Test application queries against migrated data
- Estimated time: 1 hour from 8-hour roadmap

## QA Results

**Status**: Ready for QA  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Test Plan**: [Master Test Plan](../test_plans/plan1.md)  
**Test Cases**: [Database Migration Test Cases](../test_cases/case3.md) - TC028 through TC033  
**Priority**: Critical - Zero data loss tolerance  

### Test Coverage
- LocalDB data export and analysis
- Azure SQL Database data import process
- Data integrity and quality validation
- Application data access testing
- Database performance and optimization
- Backup and recovery validation

### Notes
- Requires 100% data integrity validation - no data loss acceptable
- Must validate application functionality with migrated data
- Performance testing critical to ensure acceptable response times
