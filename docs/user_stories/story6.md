# Story 6: Configure Azure Key Vault Integration

## Status
Ready for QA

## Story

**As a** Developer  
**I want** to store sensitive configuration values in Azure Key Vault  
**so that** the application follows security best practices with no hardcoded credentials

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Database connection string stored securely in Azure Key Vault
2. Application Insights instrumentation key stored in Key Vault
3. Managed Identity configured for App Service to access Key Vault
4. Application updated to retrieve secrets from Key Vault on startup
5. Local development fallback maintained for developer productivity
6. Key Vault access policies configured with least privilege

## Dev Notes

- Use Azure SDK for .NET to integrate with Key Vault
- Implement DefaultAzureCredential for authentication
- Configure access policies for App Service Managed Identity
- Estimated time: 1 hour from 8-hour roadmap

## QA Results

**Status**: Ready for QA  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Test Plan**: [Master Test Plan](../test_plans/plan1.md)  
**Test Cases**: [Configuration Stories Test Cases](../test_cases/case2.md) - TC016 through TC022  
**Priority**: High - Security and configuration management  

### Test Coverage
- Azure Key Vault setup and access validation
- Secret storage and retrieval testing
- Application Key Vault integration
- DefaultAzureCredential authentication flow
- Key Vault access performance testing
- Security validation and audit testing
- Disaster recovery and backup scenarios

### Notes
- Security is paramount - no sensitive data should be exposed
- Managed Identity authentication must be thoroughly tested
- Performance impact of Key Vault access must be acceptable
- Disaster recovery scenarios must be validated
