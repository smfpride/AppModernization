# Test Plan 3: .NET 8 Migration Validation for Story 9

## Test Plan Overview

**Story**: Story 9 - Modernize eShopLegacyMVC Application Code to .NET 8  
**Date Created**: October 5, 2025  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Version**: 1.0

## Objective

Validate the successful migration of the eShopLegacyMVC application from .NET Framework 4.7.2 to .NET 8, ensuring all functionality is preserved and the application meets modern .NET standards.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Build verification for both main and test projects
- Framework migration validation (ASP.NET Core MVC, EF Core 8)
- Package compatibility and dependency resolution
- Unit test execution and validation
- Configuration system migration verification
- Performance and compatibility validation

### Out of Scope
- Database migration execution (covered in deployment testing)
- Live Azure Key Vault integration testing (requires live endpoints)
- End-to-end functional testing (covered in integration testing)
- Production deployment validation

## Test Environment

- **Target Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code
- **Build System**: .NET CLI (dotnet command)
- **Test Framework**: MSTest
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **SDK Version**: .NET 9.0.305 (supports .NET 8)

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Build Verification Tests
**Objective**: Ensure both projects build successfully with .NET 8

#### Test Cases:
- TC8.1: Solution-level build verification
- TC8.2: Main project build verification
- TC8.3: Test project build verification

- TC9.3: Dependency injection container verification
- TC9.4: Configuration system migration validation
- TC9.5: Static files and wwwroot validation

### Phase 3: Unit Test Validation
**Objective**: Ensure all unit tests execute and functionality is preserved

#### Test Cases:
- TC10.1: Unit test execution verification
- TC10.2: Test result analysis and validation
- TC10.3: Skipped test investigation
- TC10.4: Legacy test compatibility verification

### Phase 4: Package and Dependency Tests
**Objective**: Validate NuGet package compatibility and dependency resolution

#### Test Cases:

# Test Plan 3: Story 8 End-to-End Integration Testing

## Test Execution Summary

**Story**: Story 8 - End-to-End Integration Testing and Validation  
**QA Engineer**: Taylor  
**Test Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL FAILURE - DEPLOYMENT ISSUE**  

## üö® Critical Findings

### Primary Issue: Complete Deployment Failure
**Issue**: The Azure App Service is serving the default Azure welcome page instead of the eShopLegacyMVC application.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **App Service Configuration**: The App Service (`app-eshop-prototype-eastus2`) is configured as a regular Windows App Service running .NET Framework 4.0, not as a container deployment
2. **Container Image Status**: Container image exists in Azure Container Registry: `acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0`
3. **Deployment Gap**: The container image was built and pushed to ACR but was never deployed to the App Service
4. **Configuration Mismatch**: App Service settings show:
   - `linuxFxVersion: ""` (empty)
   - `windowsFxVersion: null` 
   - `scmType: "None"` (no deployment source)
   - Regular .NET Framework configuration instead of container

## Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Result | Issues Found |
|---------------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Application Accessibility** | ‚ùå FAIL | Critical | Default Azure page instead of application |
| **Catalog Functionality** | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | N/A | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| **Filtering & Search** | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | N/A | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| **Web API Endpoints** | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | N/A | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| **Application Insights** | ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED | N/A | Cannot test - app not deployed |
| **Performance & Security** | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Mixed | HTTPS works, but wrong content served |

## Technical Investigation Results

### App Service Status
- **URL**: https://app-eshop-prototype-eastus2.azurewebsites.net
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK (but wrong content)
- **Service State**: Running
- **Platform**: Windows App Service (should be Windows Container)

### Container Registry Status  
- **Registry**: acreshopprototype.azurecr.io ‚úÖ
- **Repository**: eshoplegacymvc ‚úÖ  
- **Tag**: v1.0 ‚úÖ
- **Full Image**: acreshopprototype.azurecr.io/eshoplegacymvc:v1.0 ‚úÖ

### Configuration Issues Identified
1. **No Container Deployment**: App Service not configured to use container image
2. **Missing Container Settings**: LinuxFxVersion and WindowsFxVersion both empty/null
3. **No Deployment Source**: scmType is "None"
4. **Wrong Runtime**: Configured for .NET Framework 4.0 instead of container runtime

## Impact Assessment

### Story 8 Acceptance Criteria Status
1. ‚ùå **Catalog page displays products**: FAIL - Application not accessible
2. ‚ùå **Product images load successfully**: FAIL - Application not accessible  
3. ‚ùå **Brand and type filtering works**: FAIL - Application not accessible
4. ‚ùå **Web API endpoints return JSON**: FAIL - Application not accessible
5. ‚ùå **Application Insights logs data**: FAIL - Application not accessible
6. ‚ùå **No error messages observed**: FAIL - Fundamental deployment error

### Business Impact
- **Severity**: Critical - Complete system failure
- **User Impact**: 100% - No functionality available
- **Deployment Status**: Failed - Story 7 completion status incorrect

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **DevOps Priority 1**: Configure App Service for Windows container deployment
2. **DevOps Priority 2**: Deploy container image to App Service
3. **Dev Priority**: Verify container image functionality
4. **QA Priority**: Re-test once deployment is fixed

### Technical Requirements for Fix
1. Configure App Service to use Windows containers
2. Set container image source to ACR
3. Configure container deployment settings
4. Update environment variables for container runtime
5. Validate startup and health checks

## Test Plan Next Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Deployment (DevOps)
- Configure container deployment on App Service
- Deploy container image from ACR
- Validate successful deployment

### Phase 2: Re-execute Story 8 Tests (QA)
- Complete application accessibility testing
- Validate all catalog functionality
- Test API endpoints and database connectivity
- Verify Application Insights integration
- Performance and security testing

### Phase 3: Final Validation
- Confirm all acceptance criteria met
- Update story status to complete
- Document lessons learned

## Dependencies for Resolution

**Blockers**:
- Story 7 deployment must be properly completed
- DevOps team must configure container deployment
- Infrastructure must support Windows containers

**Prerequisites for Re-testing**:
- Application accessible at public URL
- Container successfully running in App Service
- Basic health checks passing

---

**Next Steps**: Hand off to DevOps team for immediate deployment fix, then schedule re-testing once container is properly deployed.
