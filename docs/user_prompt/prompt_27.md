# User Prompt 27

**Date:** October 4, 2025
**User Request:** It looks like you weren't able to build during testing. Check the #file:coding-standards-analysis.md for the right build command, since this is .NET 4.7.2

## Context
User is pointing out that I failed to properly build the application during testing and should reference the coding standards document for the correct .NET Framework build command.
