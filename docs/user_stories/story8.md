# Story 8: End-to-End Integration Testing and Validation

## Status
Ready for QA

## Story

**As a** QA Engineer  
**I want** to validate that all eShopLegacyMVC functionality works correctly in Azure  
**so that** we can confirm the prototype meets acceptance criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Catalog page displays all products correctly from Azure SQL Database
2. Product images load successfully from the deployed application
3. Brand and type filtering functionality works as expected
4. Web API endpoints return correct JSON responses
5. Application Insights logs basic request/response data
6. No error messages or broken functionality observed during testing

## Dev Notes

- Test complete user journey through catalog functionality
- Validate API endpoints using browser dev tools or Postman
- Check Application Insights for basic telemetry
- Estimated time: 1 hour from 8-hour roadmap

## QA Results

**Status**: Ready for QA
