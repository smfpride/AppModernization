# User Prompt 32

## User Request
Continue with the user's original tasks - we've resolved the test assembly loading issues and now need to check Azure Key Vault infrastructure.

## Context
Successfully resolved test errors and Azure.Core version conflicts:
- Fixed 13 out of 34 unit tests that were failing with Azure.Core and System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions version conflicts
- Added comprehensive binding redirects to both Web.config and App.config  
- Fixed configuration deployment issues by including App.config in test project file
- Updated binding redirects to match actually deployed assembly versions (e.g., System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions 4.2.0.0)
- Test results improved: Now 27/34 pass, 4 fail (logic issues, no assembly loading errors), 3 skipped

## Remaining Tasks
1. Address the 4 remaining test failures (KeyVault-related test logic issues)
2. Check Azure Key Vault infrastructure deployment status
3. Deploy Key Vault infrastructure if needed
4. Add any missing web.config entries for complete test coverage

## Status
✅ Fixed test assembly loading errors and version conflicts
⏳ Need to address remaining KeyVault test logic issues and infrastructure
