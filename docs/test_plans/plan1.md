# Test Plan 1: eShopLegacyMVC Azure Modernization Testing Strategy

## Overview
This master test plan covers the comprehensive testing strategy for modernizing the eShopLegacyMVC application to run on Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. The testing approach ensures all functionality remains intact during the modernization process while validating new cloud-native capabilities.

## Project Scope
- **Application**: eShopLegacyMVC (.NET Framework 4.7.2 MVC application)
- **Target Platform**: Azure App Service for Containers with supporting Azure services
- **Duration**: 8-hour implementation timeline
- **Stories Covered**: 8 user stories from containerization to end-to-end validation

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components and business logic remain functional
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure proper integration between application layers and external services
- **System Testing**: Validate complete application functionality in Azure environment
- **Acceptance Testing**: Confirm all user stories meet acceptance criteria

### 2. Test Environments
- **Local Development**: Docker containers running locally for initial validation
- **Azure Staging**: Pre-production Azure environment mirroring production setup
- **Azure Production**: Final deployment environment for acceptance testing

### 3. Test Categories

#### Functional Testing
- Catalog functionality (product display, filtering, search)
- Web API endpoints and responses
- Data integrity and consistency
- User interface functionality

#### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance**: Application startup time, response times, resource utilization
- **Security**: Configuration security, Key Vault integration, authentication
- **Reliability**: Container stability, database connection resilience
- **Compatibility**: Browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness

#### Cloud-Specific Testing
- **Containerization**: Docker build, container startup, port exposure
- **Azure Integration**: Managed Identity, Key Vault access, Application Insights
- **Database Migration**: Schema integrity, data consistency, connection string validation
- **Infrastructure**: Resource provisioning, networking, security groups

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Database Migration**: Data integrity during LocalDB to Azure SQL migration
2. **Configuration Management**: Environment variable and Key Vault integration
3. **Container Runtime**: Windows container compatibility and startup reliability
4. **Network Connectivity**: Database connections and external dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive data validation checksums
- Fallback configuration mechanisms for local development
- Container health checks and startup validation
- Connection retry policies and timeout handling

## Test Data Management
- **Catalog Data**: Use existing sample product data from LocalDB
- **Test Images**: Validate all product images (1.png through 12.png) load correctly
- **Brand/Type Data**: Ensure all CatalogBrands and CatalogTypes migrate successfully

## Success Criteria
- All 8 user stories pass acceptance criteria validation
- No critical or high-severity defects in production environment
- Application performance meets or exceeds baseline measurements
- Zero data loss during migration process
- Security scan passes with no high-risk vulnerabilities

## Testing Schedule
1. Stories 1-2: Container and Configuration Testing (Days 1-2)
2. Story 3: Infrastructure Validation (Day 2)
3. Stories 4-5: Database Migration Testing (Days 3-4)
4. Story 6: Security and Key Vault Testing (Day 4)
5. Story 7: Deployment and Integration Testing (Day 5)
6. Story 8: End-to-End Validation and Sign-off (Day 5)

## Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria
- Development team has completed implementation for each story
- Test environment is provisioned and accessible
- Test data is prepared and available
- Required test tools and access permissions are in place

### Exit Criteria
- All test cases executed with documented results

- Performance benchmarks met
- Acceptance criteria validated by stakeholders
- Go/No-Go decision documented

## Deliverables
- Test case execution reports
- Defect reports and resolution status
- Performance test results
- Security validation reports
- User story acceptance sign-off documentation

## Tools and Technologies
- **Containerization Testing**: Docker Desktop, Windows containers
- **Database Testing**: SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio
- **API Testing**: Postman, browser developer tools
- **Performance Testing**: Application Insights, Azure Monitor
- **Security Testing**: Azure Security Center, Key Vault audit logs

## Test Team Responsibilities
- **QA Engineer (Taylor)**: Test plan creation, test case execution, defect tracking
- **Developer**: Unit test implementation, defect resolution
- **DevOps Engineer**: Environment setup, deployment validation
- **Technical Project Manager**: Acceptance criteria validation, stakeholder communication
