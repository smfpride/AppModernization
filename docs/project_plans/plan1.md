# Product Requirements Document: eShopLegacyMVC Azure PaaS Modernization

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Program Manager:** Jordan  
**Project:** eShopLegacyMVC Azure Modernization Prototype  
**Timeline:** 8 Hours  

## Executive Summary

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the scope, objectives, and requirements for modernizing the eShopLegacyMVC application to run on Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings. Based on architectural decisions ADR001 and ADR002, this initiative focuses on a rapid 8-hour prototype that demonstrates the viability of migrating the legacy .NET Framework 4.7.2 application to Azure using containerization and cloud-native services.

## Problem Statement

The eShopLegacyMVC application currently runs on-premises with SQL Server LocalDB and represents a typical legacy .NET Framework application that needs cloud modernization to:

- **Scalability Challenges:** Limited ability to handle variable load
- **Operational Overhead:** Manual deployment and maintenance processes
- **Security Concerns:** Hardcoded connection strings and limited authentication options
- **Cost Optimization:** Fixed infrastructure costs regardless of usage
- **Disaster Recovery:** Limited backup and recovery capabilities

## Business Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Rapid Prototype Delivery:** Demonstrate Azure PaaS migration within 8 hours
2. **Proof of Concept:** Validate architectural decisions for full modernization
3. **Risk Mitigation:** Identify technical challenges early in the modernization journey
4. **Foundation Building:** Establish infrastructure patterns for future development

### Success Metrics
- Application fully functional on Azure PaaS within 8 hours
- Database successfully migrated to Azure SQL Database
- Zero hardcoded credentials in production deployment
- Basic Application Insights logging functional (existing configuration)
- Total infrastructure cost under $200/month for prototype

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Azure Subscription:** Active subscription with appropriate service limits
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio 2019/2022 with Docker support
- **Source Code Access:** Current eShopLegacyMVC codebase buildable locally
- **Database Access:** Ability to export LocalDB schema and data
- **Network Connectivity:** Stable internet connection for Azure resource creation

### Assumptions
- **Skills Availability:** Team has basic Azure and Docker knowledge
- **Resource Limits:** Azure subscription has sufficient quota for required services
- **Timeline Commitment:** Full 8-hour block available for uninterrupted work
- **Scope Discipline:** Stakeholders committed to prototype-only scope
- **Rollback Plan:** Current on-premises deployment remains available during prototype

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
1. **Database Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk:** Entity Framework compatibility issues with Azure SQL
   - **Mitigation:** Test EF migrations in dev environment first

2. **Container Performance**
   - **Risk:** Windows containers may have performance overhead
   - **Mitigation:** Establish performance baselines before migration

3. **Configuration Dependencies**
   - **Risk:** Hidden configuration dependencies not documented
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing in containerized environment

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Azure Service Limits:** Potential quota limitations during provisioning
2. **Network Connectivity:** Database connectivity issues from App Service
3. **Authentication Flow:** Managed Identity setup complexity
